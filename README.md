**About**
---------

A simple web app that works like virtual phonebook. It allows user to create a "friend"
add phone number, email, social. It allows user to edit the info or delete "friend"
enitirely. This app can be used as a back up if a person would loose his/her phone with 
all the contacts in it.

-------------------
**Features so far**
-------------------

**CRUD.** User can CREATE "friend" with info attached to it. User can READ existing "friend" info.
User can UPDATE existing "friend" info. User can DESTROY "friend" entirely.

**Devise.** Person needs to become a user by creating an account. For this purpose Devise was
used. Only a registered user can create their "friends" list.

**Associations.** User can create and edit his own "friends". User can not modify or see other users
"friends".

**Bootstrap.** Minimal styling and better UI. "Friend" gets highlighted when mouse cursor rolls over,
styling to buttons, styling for sign in page, using association hide tabs on header if user
is not signed in etc.

----------------
**Future plans**
----------------

- Definitely needs more styling. 
- Might need to add more data for "friend" f.e. date of birth.
- Search bar. It is there, but it for the looks. It would help to find a specific "friend".
